## Project Overview

The portfolio allows users to browse through a collection of photographs in a grid layout. Users can select any photo from the grid, which then displays the selected photo in a larger viewer above the grid. The viewer comes with navigation arrows to browse through the photos in a slideshow manner.

## Features

1. **Photo Grid**: A responsive grid showcasing all the photos. Each photo is clickable, allowing the user to select a photo to view in the larger viewer.

2. **Photo Viewer**: A larger photo viewer for an immersive viewing experience. It displays the currently selected photo in high resolution.

3. **Slideshow Controls**: Navigation arrows in the Photo Viewer for cycling through the photos, one at a time, in either direction.
